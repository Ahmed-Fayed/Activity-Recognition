# Activity-Recognition
Activity Recognition Python, Tensorflow &amp; Keras

Still working on it...

Classifying six activities:

1-	WALKING

2-	WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3-	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4-	SITTING

5-	STANDING

6-	LAYING

There are three main signal types in the raw data: total acceleration (gravitational), body acceleration, and body gyroscope (angular velocity). Each has 3 axises of data. This means that there are a total of nine variables for each time step.
